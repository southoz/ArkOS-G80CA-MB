# ArkOS-G80CA-MB

For God's sake, I brought another cheap Chinese game console!

It turned up, and as most know, buying a R36S from Aliexpress is like playing Russian Roulette.

Thanks to the great resources over at https://handhelds.wiki/R36S_Clones, I was able to identify that it was a G80CA-MB V1.2-20250422.

Obviously, the included firmware is less than optimal, so I went on the hunt.

Tried ArkOS4Clone; it worked, but in the end, it wasn't supported, and the screen was banding.

Downloaded ArkOS for K36 and updated the DTB to Panel 8, booted, shut down, copied some files, but honestly, the experience was a bit all over the place.

Spent a minute trying to figure it out, then it all came flooding back like a bad case of PTSD.
